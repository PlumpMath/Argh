        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Control with arrow keys.  You can also strafe with A and D,
          and halt the game by pressing ESC.

          Source is <a href="https://github.com/thomcc/Argh">located
          on github</a>. This game was extremely frustruating to
          develop, hence its name. There's a longish list of known
          bugs. All I can say is that for the (most) perfect
          experience, use chrome.

          Known issues: If you use firefox and it is stuck on
        "generating level...", try refreshing.  If you use safari and
        are getting an intermittent black flicker, try refreshing.  If
        you use firefox and _can_ hear sound, let me know, seems to
        only work locally. If you use IE, I wish you luck as you are
        entering untested waters.

          This was largely practice for writing a game in
        ClojureScript
        for <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare
        23</a>, a game competition, so it's very incomplete.</p>
